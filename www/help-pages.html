    <h3>Why do I need this?</h3>
    <p> Is not not so intuitive to create good passwords, it is very common for people to create weak passwords, because weak passwords are easier to create and remember. Our mind is not very good with create random values because we stop to think each word or character to put into our password.</p>
    <p>Very common weak passwords is names of peoples, animals and objects; birthdays dates; simple sequences of numbers or characters; ex.:(michael, monkey, football, 19890215, 123456, qwerty).</p>
    <p>Hackers utilize softwares to break passwords. Basicly these programs try to match random values with user's passwords. Weak passwords fall first. Strong passwords resist more. It's like compare  a garden fence to a fortress wall. You know which is the safest against attacks.</p>
